# CIS421 - Database Final Project
Welcome to our Bookstore Database project for CIS421! Below are the required packages for installment, along with instructions on how to run the website.

Please ensure that the following packages are present in your environment, using the following commands:
- `npm install mysql`
- `npm install express`
- `npm install cors`

This website hosts the database locally through MySQL using Xampp. Requirements for creating an instance of the database can be found in the 'db.js' file.

In order to run the website, you must complete the following steps:
1. Ensure that Xampp is running.
2. In one terminal, ensure that you are in the /backend folder. Run `node server` in order to start the backend server and connect to the MySQL database.
3. In another terminal, ensure that you are in the /frontend folder. Run `npm start` in order to launch the frontend on your local host. 

Once the website is running, you can now interact with your bookstore database using the UI! :)
